# Data-Analytics
This repository has some projects on data analytics.
## Lab1:
  - It answers some question:
  - Question 1: Load in the provided dataset 20to22NYC.csv and summarize the basic statistics. Specifically your code should answer:
      - What are the feature types and their basic statistics (using describe(include='all'))
      - How many features have missing values?
      - What are the patterns of missing values and potential missing data reason for the top-3 most missed features.
  - Question 2: Check the normality of the target variable, i.e., 'SALE PRICE', using both graphical and statistical test methods.
  - Question 3: Design hypothesis test to answer the following two questions:
      - "Has the NYC real estate market changed following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020?"
      - "Do properties in Manhattan sell at higher prices than properties elsewhere?"
      - For each question, you need to give the null hypothesis $H_0$ and alternative hypothesis $H_1$
  - Question 4: Perform a multiple linear regression analysis on the given data, considering impact of missing values. Note, you need to properly transfer categorical features to numerical features first. Report the features that are significant relevant to sale price based on the results of your regression model.
